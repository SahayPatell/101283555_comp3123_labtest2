# Weather App - ReactJs
Welcome to the weather app
Overheard a person in the bus getting frustrated about useless
data in the mobile weather app,So I developed a weather app with RESTful API with useful data of user-entered location.
I Also increased the app performance and loading speed by 1.05s
Technologies used in the project are Reactjs, HTML, javascript, express, OpenWeatherMap API
